# Trivia party

[Play here](https://tismas.github.io/trivia-party)

### Plan

TODO:

- when player disconnects, show as if he left room but still allow him to reconnect
- fix issue when someone enters the page from 2 tabs and lefts one of the tabs
- add ready state instead of starting the game right away
- custom question db
- 3 category votes with 3 questions each

- if player gets disconnected but returns to the tab, redirect him to home page - also, make the disconnect timeout longer
